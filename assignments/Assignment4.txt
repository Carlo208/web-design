Answer 1
To link pages in HTML, you can use the anchor <a> tag. Here's a theoretical way to link pages in HTML:
Create the Anchor Tag: Use the <a> tag to create a link. Inside the tag, specify the destination page's URL in the href attribute. For example:
html
<a href="page2.html">Go to Page 2</a>
Relative Path: If the page you want to link to is in the same directory as the current page, you can simply provide the file name in the href attribute. If it's in a different directory, you can specify the path accordingly.

3. Absolute Path: If the page is on a different website, you can use the full URL in the href attribute. For example:
   html
   <a href="https://www.example.com/page2.html">Go to Page 2</a>

   ANSWER 2
   To apply external CSS to pages in HTML, you can follow these theoretical steps:

1. Create a CSS File: First, create a separate CSS file with the styles you want to apply to your HTML pages. Save this file with a .css extension. For example, you can create a file named styles.css.

1. Link the CSS File to HTML: In your HTML file, within the <head> section, use the <link> tag to link the external CSS file. Specify the path to your CSS file in the href attribute. For example:
html
<link rel="stylesheet" type="text/css" href="styles.css">

     css
     #my-id {
     font-size: 20px;
     }
     Tag Name: You can apply styles to all elements of a specific tag by targeting the tag name in CSS. Here's how you can do it:
