   section of your HTML document. Here's the steps

1.  we first Download Bootstrap: 
   - Visit the official Bootstrap website and download the Bootstrap files (CSS and JavaScript).

2. Include Bootstrap in your HTML file:
   - Open your HTML file in a text editor.
   - Add the following code in the <head> section of your HTML document to link the Bootstrap CSS file:
     html
     <link rel="stylesheet" href="path/to/bootstrap/css/bootstrap.min.css">
     
     Replace "path/to/bootstrap/css/bootstrap.min.css" with the actual path to your downloaded Bootstrap CSS file.

     html
     <script src="path/to/bootstrap/js/bootstrap.min.js"></script>

     To create columns on your web pages using Bootstrap, you can utilize the grid
      system provided by Bootstrap. The grid system allows you to 
      divide your page into rows and columns,
       making it easy to create responsive layouts.

Here's an example of how you can create columns using Bootstrap:

html
<div class="container">
    <div class="row">
        <div class="col-md-6">
            <!-- Content for the first column -->
        </div>
        <div class="col-md-6">
            <!-- Content for the second column -->
        </div>
    </div>
</div>
